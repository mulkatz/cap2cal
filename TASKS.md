# TASKS
- in the web folder the plan is to build here the landing page for the project which acts as a promo page that should lead potential users to download the app
- at the moment in the web folder there are sources of another landing page I build but I am pretty happy with the overall layout but of course, the content doesn't fit
- So the task is to analyse the existing landing page and the concept for the landing page which can be found in /docs and then refactor / rebuild the landing page accordingly. To build all its contents take also all the relevant information from documents in docs that might be helpful
- also firebase and stuff in that folder needs to be refactored
- You can first build a migration plan for you, if this is helpful
- the plan is to have an adjusted, well designed and contentful landing page for cap2cal (not event snap, cap2cal is the name)
