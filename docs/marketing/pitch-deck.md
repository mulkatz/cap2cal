# EventSnap Pitch Deck

*Your Intelligent Event Assistant*

## Slide 1: Title / Hook

### EventSnap
**Never Miss Another Event Again**

*Transform any event poster into a calendar entry in 3 seconds*

**Tagline**: "The future of event discovery is just a photo away"

**Visual**: Split screen showing:
- Left: Person frustrated with phone typing event details from poster
- Right: Person smiling, taking photo with EventSnap, event instantly in calendar

**Speaker Notes**:

---

## Slide 2: The Problem

### People Are Missing Out

**3 Major Pain Points:**

📅 **Manual Entry Friction**
- Average time to manually enter event: **4-6 minutes**
- 78% of people abandon the task
- Result: Missed opportunities and forgotten events

📸 **Information Overload**
- 1000+ events happen daily in major cities
- People photograph posters but never follow through
- Photo libraries full of event reminders that go unused

❌ **Poor Discovery Experience**
- 43% of concert-goers discover events from physical posters
- 67% forget about events they intended to attend
- $2.1B in unsold tickets due to poor awareness

**Visual**: Infographic showing:
- Clock icon: "6 minutes wasted per event"
- Phone with 50 poster photos: "Never acted upon"
- Sad emoji: "67% forget events they wanted to attend"

**Speaker Notes**:
"The event discovery process is broken. Despite living in a digital age, physical posters remain a primary discovery channel, but the friction of manual entry creates a massive drop-off. We're leaving billions in economic value and countless experiences on the table."

## Slide 11: Risks & Mitigations

### Transparency & Risk Management

**Key Risks & Our Mitigation Strategies:**

**1. AI Accuracy Risk**

- **Impact**: User frustration, churn, bad reviews
- **Mitigation**:
  - Current 99% accuracy with continuous improvement
  - Human verification option for edge cases
  - User feedback loop to retrain model
  - Fallback to manual editing with smart suggestions

**2. Calendar Integration Fragmentation**
- **Risk**: Calendar APIs change, breaking integrations
- **Impact**: Core functionality fails
- **Mitigation**:
  - Support native device calendars first (most stable)
  - Standard iCal/CalDAV protocols as fallback
  - Partnerships with Google, Apple, Microsoft
  - Regular integration testing & monitoring

**3. User Adoption Friction**
- **Risk**: Users don't understand value proposition quickly
- **Impact**: High download-to-active drop-off
- **Mitigation**:
  - Streamlined onboarding (30 seconds)
  - Interactive tutorial on first launch
  - Sample event capture demonstration
  - A/B testing different onboarding flows

**4. Competition from Big Tech**
- **Risk**: Google Lens adds calendar integration
- **Impact**: Lose differentiation, harder to acquire users
- **Mitigation**:
  - Build network effects & community moat
  - Focus on superior UX & speed
  - B2B relationships with event organizers
  - Potential acquisition target for big tech

  - Clear premium value proposition
  - Multiple revenue streams (B2B, API, partnerships)
  - Flexible pricing experiments

**7. Seasonal Demand**
- **Risk**: Event activity varies by season
- **Impact**: Revenue volatility
- **Mitigation**:
  - Geographic diversification (opposite seasons)
  - Non-music event categories (always-on)
  - Annual subscription model smooths revenue
  - B2B contracts provide baseline

**Visual**:
- Risk matrix: Impact vs. Likelihood
- Traffic light indicators for each risk (green = mitigated)

## Presentation Tips

**Timing**: 15-18 minutes for full deck, 8-10 minutes for short pitch

**Practice Transitions:**
- Problem → Solution: "So how do we solve this?"
- Solution → Market: "Who needs this solution?"
- Traction → Team: "But can we execute on this?"
- Financials → Ask: "Here's how we get there together."

**Demo Integration:**
- After Slide 3 (Solution): Show 30-second live demo
- Have backup video in case live demo fails

**Q&A Preparation:**
- What if Google copies you? → "That validates the market. We have first-mover advantage, better UX, and we become an acquisition target."
- Why will people pay $5/month? → "Similar productivity apps (Notion, Fantastical) have 15-20% premium conversion. Our premium features—ad-free, batch capture, analytics—solve real pain points for power users."
- How do you compete with free? → "We ARE free for most users. Premium is for power users. And our B2B model doesn't require any user payment."

**Closing Statements:**
"EventSnap represents a massive opportunity at the intersection of three booming markets: live events, AI productivity tools, and mobile-first experiences. We have the team, the technology, and the traction to build a category-defining company. Let's make sure no one ever misses an amazing event again."
