"Frequently Asked Questions"

[Accordion-style Q&A]
Each question: Expandable, with icon
```

### Copy

**Headline (H2):**
"Got Questions? We've Got Answers."

**Q1: How accurate is the AI extraction?**
A: EventSnap's AI achieves 99% accuracy on event posters. Our model has been trained on over 100,000 posters across 8 languages. In rare cases where the AI isn't confident, you'll see an editable preview before saving.

**Q2: Which calendars does EventSnap work with?**
A: EventSnap works with ALL calendar apps: Google Calendar, Apple Calendar (iCal), Microsoft Outlook, and any other calendar app on your phone. We use standard calendar APIs that work universally.

**Q3: Is my data private and secure?**
A: Absolutely. All captured events are stored locally on your device by default. We don't upload your photos or event data to our servers unless you opt-in to cloud sync. We're GDPR and CCPA compliant from day one.

**Q4: Does EventSnap work offline?**
A: Yes! You can capture events offline. They'll be processed and added to your calendar automatically once you're back online. Perfect for festivals with spotty service.

**Q5: What languages does EventSnap support?**
A: Currently, EventSnap extracts events in English, German, Spanish, French, Portuguese, Italian, Japanese, and Korean. More languages coming soon!

**Q6: Is EventSnap really free?**
A: Yes! Core features—unlimited captures, AI extraction, calendar integration—are 100% free forever. We offer an optional Premium tier ($4.99/month) with advanced features like batch capture, analytics, and ad-free experience.

**Q7: What makes EventSnap different from Google Lens?**
A: While Google Lens can extract text from images, it doesn't understand events or integrate with calendars. EventSnap is purpose-built for event posters, achieving 99% accuracy and seamlessly adding events to your calendar in one tap.

**Q8: Can I capture multiple events at once?**
A: The free version processes one event at a time. Premium users get batch capture mode, perfect for festival lineups with 50+ artists.

**Q9: What if the AI makes a mistake?**
A: Before saving, you'll see a preview card with all extracted details. You can edit anything that looks wrong. Plus, every correction helps train our AI to be even better.

**Q10: Can I share events with friends?**
A: Yes! You can share captured events via text, email, or social media. Your friends don't need EventSnap to see the event details (but they should definitely download it!).

**Q11: Does EventSnap drain my battery?**
A: No. EventSnap uses on-device processing where possible and only communicates with our servers for AI extraction. Most users report negligible battery impact.

**Q12: Will you sell my data?**
A: Never. We don't sell user data. Period. Our business model is based on premium subscriptions and B2B partnerships with event organizers—not selling your information.

## Final Notes

### Key Success Factors
1. **Hero section** must immediately communicate value (3 seconds)
2. **Social proof** throughout to build trust
3. **Clear, frequent CTAs** (download buttons)
4. **Mobile-first** design and testing
5. **Fast load times** (< 3s)
6. **SEO optimization** for organic traffic
7. **Compelling visuals** (demo video, animations)
8. **Address objections** (privacy, accuracy, cost)

### Next Steps for Implementation
1. Create high-fidelity designs in Figma
2. Write all copy and get reviewed
3. Build responsive landing page
4. Set up analytics and tracking
5. Test on real devices
6. Launch and iterate based on data

**This landing page is designed to convert visitors into app downloads by addressing pain points, demonstrating clear value, and removing friction from the decision-making process.**
