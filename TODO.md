# TODO
- I want to change the routing / visual structure of the app 
- at the moment we have our listview and import icons on the main page and the camera view
- in the future the icons should only be visible on the main page
- whenever a photo is taken there should be another layer with the same background and pattern as the main page, the darkened and the event result card(s) are displayed over it
- we need an additional button there that says something like 'done' in lead to the main page / or closes the result page (maybe this can be handled with the state property)
